# silly little app i call gitpals

## Expand your github circle  and find new developers along the way

#### **uses github rest api and react with vite **</br>
barely past the UI mockup phase and the follow button doesn't work for now.

To make it work add a .env file in the root directory not /src 

and add your github access token like 

```js
VITE_TOKEN=your github token here with no quotes
```
and run 

```js
npm run dev
```
since it's a vite react app ,</br>
 don't expose your token especially if it has write access make sure to make the .rnv to 
.gitignore


### open to colaboration
